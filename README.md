# RC-2021-11-19
A solution to the Riddler Classic of November 19, 2021

ðŸŸ¥-1, ðŸŸ¨0, ðŸŸ¦+1
```
sgn(L-R) ðŸ™‚  ðŸ™‚ -sgn(L+R)
           âš«
sgn(L-R) ðŸ™‚  ðŸ™‚ sgn(L+R)
```
Found by brute force search of the 2\*3^27 different ways players could share 3 distinct strategies. Only using 1-2 strategies didn't work.

I found the first version of the answer 2.2% of the way through.

My initial attempts at the problem and the code that double-checked my answer. Requires Python 3.10.

## [./rc2021-11-19.cpp]
The code that solved the problem. Originally compiled with Visual Studio 2019. I think the only non-C code I used was the `inline` compiler hint and `std::cout`.
